                <h2>What is a User story ?</h2>
                <p>In software development and product management, a user story is an informal, natural language
                    description of features of a software system. They are written from the perspective of an end user
                    or user of a system, and may be recorded on index cards, Post-it notes, or digitally in project
                    management software. Depending on the project, user stories may be written by different stakeholders
                    like client, user, manager, or development team.

                    User stories are a type of boundary object. They facilitate sensemaking and communication; and may
                    help software teams document their understanding of the system and its context. </p>

                <h2>History</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><span>1998 - </span> Alistair Cockburn visited the Chrysler C3 project in Detroit and coined
                        the phrase "A user story is a promise for a conversation."</li>
                    <li><span>1999 - </span>Kent Beck published the first edition of the book Extreme Programming
                        Explained, introducing Extreme Programming (XP), and the usage of user stories in the
                        planning game.</li>
                    <li><span>2001 - </span> Ron Jeffries proposed a "Three Cs" formula for user story creation</li>
                    <li><span>2001 - </span> The XP team at Connextra in London devised the user story format and
                        shared examples with others.</li>
                    <li><span>2004 - </span> Mike Cohn generalized the principles of user stories beyond the usage
                        of cards in his book User Stories Applied: For Agile Software Development that is now
                        considered the standard reference for the topic according to Martin Fowler. Cohn names
                        Rachel Davies as the inventor of user stories. While Davies was a team member at Connextra
                        she credits the team as a whole with the invention.</li>
                    <li><span>2014 - </span> After a first article in 2005 and a blog post in 2008, in 2014 Jeff
                        Patton published the user-story mapping technique, which intends to improve with a
                        systematic approach the identification of user stories and to structure the stories to give
                        better visibility to their interdependence.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Principle</h2>
                <p>User stories are written by or for users or customers to influence the functionality of the system
                    being developed. In some teams, the product manager (or product owner in Scrum), is primarily
                    responsible for formulating user stories and organizing them into a product backlog. In other teams,
                    anyone can write a user story. User stories can be developed through discussion with stakeholders,
                    based on personas or simply made up. </p>

            <section>
                <h2>Benefits ?</h2>
                <p>There is no good evidence that using user stories increases software success or developer
                    productivity. However, user stories facilitate sensemaking without undue problem structuring, which
                    is linked to success</p>
